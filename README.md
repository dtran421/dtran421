- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dtran421
  Iâ€™m currently a junior studying CS and finance at William & Mary. I've taken classes on software development, data structures and algorithms,
  investments, accounting, financial management, and corporate valuation. Over the summer of 2020, I interned with a small startup called Whispearrings
  to help them develop an iOS app using Swift. The application integrated sound playback with a SQLite database to allow them to eventually interface with their product.
  
- ðŸ‘€ I'm involved in a number of clubs across campus, including the Association for Computing Machinery, Developer Student Club, and Investment Club. 
  I'm also a member of the Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, which focuses on professional development and student networking. 
  
  I am the incoming Chief Financial Officer of a student-run marketing agency at W&M called Agency 1693, which consults for companies in the Williamsburg area. 
  We produce adverts and marketing campaigns on behalf of our clients, and as CFO, I will be in charge of managing project capital as well as handling company financials.

  As a part-time occupation, I am a private tutor for Acakid, educating young kids in middle school and high school on various subjects including math, science, and 
  computer science. I help my students learn and obtain a strong understanding of the concepts covered in school while developing their critical thinking and reasoning skills.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m experienced in Python, Java, Javascript/Typescript, NodeJS, React, and MySQL. I'm currently taking classes on computer organization and utilizing C and Assembly
  to optimize code and manage low-level code execution.

- ðŸ“« If youâ€™d like to connect with me to discuss more, please feel free to send me a message or reach out via email (duketran2001@gmail.com).
