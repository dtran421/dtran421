- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dtran421
  Iâ€™m currently a junior studying CS and finance at William & Mary. I've taken classes on software development, data structures, discrete structures, algorithms, computer
  organization, investments, accounting, financial management, and corporate valuation and credit analysis. Over the summer of 2021, I interned at a research program called NSF
  REU Site: HUMANS MOVE to develop evasive algorithms paired with the SHARKS (Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous, and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms) Protocol to defend a UAV
  swarm against adversarial UAV attacks. I learned to work with Unity 3D and C# to simulate UAV swarms in VR and 3D space to gather data on the effectiveness of evasive maneuvers.
  
- ðŸ‘€ I'm involved in a number of clubs across campus, including the Association for Computing Machinery, Developer Student Club, and Investment Club. I'm also a member of the
  Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, which focuses on professional development and student networking.
  
  I am the Chief Financial Officer of a student-run marketing agency at W&M called Agency 1693, which consults for companies in the Williamsburg area. We produce adverts and
  marketing campaigns on behalf of our clients, and as CFO, I am in charge of managing project capital as well as handling company financials, invoicing, expenses, and employee
  wages.

  As a part-time occupation, I work as a Technology Program Coordinator for the Alan B. Miller Entrepreneurship Center to create applications and maintain software to propel the
  ECâ€™s missions. I utilized technological tools to streamline backend development and enable seamless user experiences.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m experienced in Python, Java, Javascript/Typescript, NodeJS, React, and MySQL. I'm currently taking classes on principles of program languages, finite automata, and  
  machine learning.
